 		<h2>Dota 2's The International surpasses $40 million in prize money</h2>
 		<h5>Date Released: October 10, 2020</h5>

 		<p><b>The International</b></p>
 		<p>The 10th edition of The International, Dota 2's largest yearly tournament, has surpassed the $40 million dollar prize pool mark for the first time ever.</p>

		<p>The milestone was crossed on Friday, Oct. 9, the final day where tournament contributions were accepted. This year's International was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a total of 136 days where the community could contribute. Last year's TI closed contributions at the 110 day mark. There is no confirmed date for The International 10, but Valve hopes to hold it in Stockholm, Sweden in August of 2021.</p>

		<p>Valve has been putting up its $1.6 million since 2011, but since 2013, fans have been able to contribute to the pot through purchases of the Dota 2 battle pass, where 25% of the cost is sent directly to the TI prize pool.</p>
		<p>The top five prize pools in esports history remain the 2015-2019 TI events in descending order, with 2020 set to take the #1 spot.</p>
